# Welcome to Cache Simulator!

This project aims to simulate the functionality of cache memory in a traditional computer. It can perform the operations that the cache does when reading, writing, and working with memory.

How to run the program:
1. Make sure all of these files are in the same directory
  -Cache.py
  -CacheEntry.py
  -MainMemory.py
  -CacheSimulator.py
  -input.txt
  -Set.py
  
2.Navigate to that directory and run the following command(don't include the quotes)
  "python3 cachesimulator.py input.txt"
